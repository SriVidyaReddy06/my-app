    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Sri Vidya Puttareddygari, a software engineer with over 3 years of hands-on experience
      in full stack development. I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer and Information
      Science, specializing in Software Engineering at Gannon University.
    </p>
    <p>
      My professional experience includes working as a Full Stack Developer at Tata Consultancy Services,
      where I contributed to the development of financial services applications for PNC Bank. I excel in
      building responsive, user-friendly interfaces using technologies such as ReactJS, .NET Core, and
      modern cloud infrastructure tools like Azure DevOps and OpenShift.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am passionate about improving software quality and performance, which led me to explore Machine
      Learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) for code smell detection. I enjoy solving complex problems,
      mentoring fellow developers, and leading scrum teams in Agile environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of work, I am dedicated to my research in Machine Learning and enjoy collaborating on projects
      related to Software Engineering. I love to explore new technologies and to work on personal creative projects. When not coding, I love exploring new places,
      hiking, listen music, read books and novels.
    </p>
